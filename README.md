# Spotify-Visualizer

This Andriod Application adds a visual component to your music listening experience!

## Instructions on Usage

Due to the processing library working funky with andriod jetpack, this will only run on native devices. 

From the spotify API, you need to add your development fingerprint so that music playing will work. You can get the development fingerprint by running in terminal:

> keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android

Then, this fingerprint has to be added to the spotify developer app settings. Ask Dylan to do that for you.

Finally, you need to have spotify downloaded and logged in on the phone that you are using the app.
